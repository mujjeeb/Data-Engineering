# Data Engineering Projects in Python

This folder contains a collection of data engineering projects written in Python. These projects focus on various aspects of data engineering, including data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), data integration, and data pipeline development. Each project is designed to demonstrate different data engineering techniques and practices. 

## Project Overview

Here is an overview of the data engineering projects included in this folder:

1. **Data Ingestion and Transformation:** This project demonstrates how to ingest data from various sources, transform it, and load it into a target data store. It may involve extracting data from databases, APIs, or flat files, and applying transformations to clean and prepare the data.

2. **Batch ETL Pipeline:** This project showcases a batch ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. It involves scheduling regular data extraction and transformation tasks to update a data warehouse or analytics platform.

3. **Real-time Data Streaming:** This project explores real-time data processing using technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, or Apache Spark Streaming. It may involve processing streaming data from sources such as IoT devices or social media platforms.

4. **Data Warehousing:** This project focuses on building a data warehouse or data mart. It includes the design and implementation of a schema, ETL processes, and creating a business intelligence layer.

5. **Data Quality and Monitoring:** This project addresses data quality and monitoring, including setting up alerts and automated checks to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

6. **Data Pipeline Orchestration:** This project covers the orchestration of data pipelines using tools like Apache Airflow, Luigi, or custom workflow management systems.

7. **Data Migration:** This project involves migrating data from one data storage solution to another, such as transitioning from on-premises databases to cloud-based data warehouses.

## Prerequisites

To run and explore these data engineering projects, you should have the following prerequisites:

- **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The specific version required may vary for each project.

- **Project Dependencies:** Each project may have its own set of dependencies. Please refer to the individual project README files for installation instructions.
