# Exploratory Analysis with Pandas

## Project Overview

The "Exploratory Analysis with Pandas" project is designed to enable you to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset using the powerful Python library, Pandas. This project provides you with the opportunity to answer questions and generate insights from the "employee.csv" dataset, as outlined in the "questions.pdf" document.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with this project, you should ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

- **Pandas**: This project heavily relies on Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. You can install Pandas using `pip`:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

## Project Structure

The project directory structure may look like this:

```
exploratory-analysis-with-pandas/
│
├── questions.pdf           # The document containing the analysis questions
├── employee.csv            # The dataset for analysis
├── Pandas Project.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for the exploratory analysis
├── README.md               # Project README file
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exploratory-analysis-with-pandas.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd exploratory-analysis-with-pandas
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies (Pandas) if not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the "exploratory_analysis.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook to perform the exploratory analysis.

## Performing the Analysis

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file, "exploratory_analysis.ipynb."

2. Load the "employee.csv" dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Review the questions in the "questions.pdf" document to guide your analysis.

4. Use Pandas functionalities within the notebook to explore the dataset, extract insights, and answer the provided questions.

## Saving Your Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook allows you to save your work with both code and results. You can save the notebook with your analysis for future reference.



## Contribution and Feedback
