# Exploratory Analysis with SQL

## Project Overview

The "Exploratory Analysis with SQL" project is designed to enable you to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset using SQL queries. This project employs the power of SQLAlchemy, a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, and the psycopg2 library to interact with PostgreSQL databases. Additionally, the project leverages Jupyter Notebook's `%load_ext sql` magic command to facilitate SQL query execution within a Python environment.

The primary goal of this project is to empower you to perform exploratory analysis, generate insights, and answer specific questions about the provided dataset using SQL. The dataset and associated questions are outlined in the "questions.pdf" document, which serves as the basis for your analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin with this project, you should ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook to run the provided Jupyter Notebook file.

- **SQLAlchemy**: This library is used to work with SQL databases in Python. You can install it using `pip`:

  ```bash
  pip install sqlalchemy
  ```

- **Psycopg2**: Psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python, which is essential for connecting to a PostgreSQL database. You can install it using `pip`:

  ```bash
  pip install psycopg2
  ```

- **Jupyter SQL Extension**: To execute SQL queries in a Jupyter Notebook, you need to load the SQL extension. You can install it using `pip`:

  ```bash
  pip install ipython-sql
  ```

## Project Structure

The project directory structure may look like this:

```
exploratory-analysis-with-sql/
│
├── questions.pdf           # The document containing the analysis questions
├── exploratory_analysis.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for the exploratory analysis
├── README.md               # Project README file
├── requirements.txt        # Dependencies for the project
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exploratory-analysis-with-sql.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd exploratory-analysis-with-sql
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the "exploratory_analysis.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook to perform the exploratory analysis.

## Performing the Analysis

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file, "exploratory_analysis.ipynb."

2. Execute the notebook cells to load the SQL extension and connect to your PostgreSQL database.

3. Review the questions in the "questions.pdf" document to guide your SQL query writing.

4. Use SQL queries within the notebook to explore the dataset, extract insights, and answer the provided questions.


## Contribution and Feedback
